When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you want to share your work with other collaborators, or distribute it to users.     Or, if you want to visualize your code in a different format.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You may still be working on something that you're not quite ready to share.
	Manual pushing allows you to push/pull changes that are ready, or in the case of
	pulling, relevant to your work. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	A fork is different from a clone because it is done on github, not in the local 
	repository. Also, a fork will give credit to the original creator and facilitate
	collaboration. Clones simply copy a repository (and automatically setup a remote)
	to your local machine. Branches copy the most recent version of a repository and 
	create a new lineage that can be tracked and rolled back separately from the 
	master. Fork is good for collaboration or politely copying someone else's work, 
	clone is good when you want to bring a repository to your local computer to work
	on it. Branches are good for local work when you want to test a new feature, etc.
