When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you want to share your work with other collaborators, or distribute it to users.     Or, if you want to visualize your code in a different format.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You may still be working on something that you're not quite ready to share.
	Manual pushing allows you to push/pull changes that are ready, or in the case of
	pulling, relevant to your work.
