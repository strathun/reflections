What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	This adds a .git folder to the directory and starts maintaining the history of the directory. This is done to tell git which directories you want to track.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area allows you to organize what files/changes you will update in a given commit. This enables you to breakup bigger changes you've made to your codebase into individual commits.
